# Machine Learning
This is a folder of common machine learning algorithms derived and implemented in python.

## Algorithms

### Supervised
This folder contains supervised learning algorithms

#### Classifiers
Identifying which categories a feature set belongs to

##### Boosting
Combining several weak classifiers into a single strong one
###### Adaboost
Weighted sum of individual classifiers

##### Linear Classifiers
Combining feature vectors with weight vectors to classify data points
###### SVM
Create a set of features (support vectors) to help define the decision boundary
###### Perceptron
Iteratively update a decision boundary based on the classification of each point. *Does not converge if not linearly seperable.
##### Neural Networks
Network of perceptrons feeding into one another

###### ANN
Straightforward Neural Network

#### Regression
Estimating relationship between inputs and their outputs

### Unsupervised
This folder contains unsupervised learning algorithms
#### Clustering
Grouping Similar Objects
##### K-Means
Using the Mean of all points in a cluster to update the center
##### K-Medians
Using the Median of all points in a cluster to update the center

## Supplements

### Validation

##### Nested Cross Validation
Method for determining the strength of a model
